This project is a simple web tool that encrypts and decrypts student identity information using the Caesar Cipher method. It works by shifting each letter in a combined string of the student's name, year, and course by a specific number (N) based on the formulas $E = (X + N) \pmod{26}$ and $D = (X - N) \pmod{26}$ . While letters are shifted forward or backward through the alphabet, all numbers, spaces, and symbols remain unchanged to ensure the original identity format is preserved. The application is built using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate basic security concepts and input validation.
